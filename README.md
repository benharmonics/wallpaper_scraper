# wallpaper_scraper
Rust program that scrapes a directory for images which are suitable to be wallpapers, then saves them to another directory.

I have a similar program in Python but I wanted to write it in Rust... just because.

## Installation

### Cargo

Clone the repository, navigate into the main `wallpaper_scraper` directory, then

```bash
cargo install
```
